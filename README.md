# The_Sparks_Foundation_tasks
Task 1: 
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
Here in this task I have implemented Linear Regression from scratch.

Task 2: 
 Implementation of K-Means from Scratch. To predict optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
 
Task 3:
To create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
